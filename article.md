The **Rate Of Change (ROC) indicator** is a valuable tool in technical analysis that calculates the percentage change in price over a given time period. The purpose of the ROC indicator is to provide valuable insights into the momentum and the speed of price movements. It does this by comparing the current price to a previous price `"n"` periods ago. Armed with this information, traders can assess how quickly or slowly market prices are rising or falling.

The ROC indicator is frequently used to spot potential trend reversals, divergences, and overbought or oversold market conditions. The positive or negative values of ROC can be used by traders to find out the strength and direction of price trends, and this helps them make more informed trading decisions.
