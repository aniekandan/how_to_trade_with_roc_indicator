Technical analysis is a widely embraced approach to studying trading that assists in forecasting future price movements. It examines historical market data, such as previous price fluctuations and trading volume, to deduce potential future outcomes. Practitioners of technical analysis hold the belief that analyzing past patterns and trends can provide valuable insights into future market dynamics. 

By analyzing charts and utilizing specialized tools, traders endeavor to identify favorable moments for buying and selling investments. The fundamental concept underlying technical analysis is that by comprehending and following price patterns, traders can enhance their decision-making abilities and gain a competitive edge in the market.

The **Rate Of Change (ROC) indicator** is a valuable tool in technical analysis that calculates the percentage change in price over a given time period. The purpose of the ROC indicator is to provide valuable insights into the momentum and the speed of price movements. It does this by comparing the current price to a previous price `"n"` periods ago. Armed with this information, traders can assess how quickly or slowly market prices are rising or falling.

The ROC indicator is frequently used to spot potential trend reversals, divergences, and overbought or oversold market conditions. The positive or negative values of ROC can be used by traders to find out the strength and direction of price trends, and this helps them make more informed trading decisions.

## Diving deeper into the ROC indicator.

The rate of change (ROC) indicator calculates the price change over a given period as a percentage. The ROC indicator calculates the difference in price between the current price and the price n periods ago and then expresses this difference as a percentage of the earlier price.

The calculated value can either be positive or negative:

- When the ROC value is positive, it indicates that prices have increased,
- On the other hand, a negative ROC value suggests a decrease in prices.

## Formula for calculating ROC

The calculation behind the formula for ROc is rather simple. The previous price must be subtracted from the current price, and the difference must then be divided by the previous price. the final ratio must then be multiplied by 100 to make it a percent. The formula can be written as follows:

```math
ROC = \dfrac {\text{current price} - \text{previous price}}{\text{previous price}} \times 100\%
```

An example will illustrate how simple the calculation actually is:

**Example**
> The current price of a stock is $50, and the price 10 periods ago was $40. Calculate the ROC over the 10 periods.

To calculate the ROC over these 10 periods, we would note that:

- current price is $50
- previous price is $40

If we entered these values into our previous formula, we would get the following simple calculation:

```math
ROC = \dfrac {50 - 40}{40} \times 100\%  
= \dfrac {10}{40} \times 100\%\\= 0.25 \times 100\%\\= 25\%
```



you would subtract $40 from $50, resulting in a difference of $10. Dividing this difference by the previous price of $40 and multiplying by 100 gives you a ROC value of 25%. This means that the price has increased by 25% over the specified time frame.
```
